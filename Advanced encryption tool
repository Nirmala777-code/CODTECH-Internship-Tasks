# ✅ Task 4: Advanced Encryption Tool

## 📌 Objective
To build a Python tool that can securely encrypt and decrypt files using strong encryption (AES-based).

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3 (via Pydroid 3 on Android)
- `cryptography` library (uses Fernet – AES encryption)

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `advanced_encryption_tool.py` – Main Python script
- `key.key` – Generated encryption key
- `test4.txt` – Original file to encrypt
- `test4.txt.enc` – Encrypted output file
- `test4_decrypted.txt` – Final decrypted file
- `task4_output.jpg` – Screenshot showing results

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Script (Pydroid 3)
1. Open the script in **Pydroid 3**
2. Run and select from menu:


=== Advanced Encryption Tool ===

1. Generate Key


2. Encrypt File


3. Decrypt File

4. 3. Use these file paths as input:
   - Encrypt:
     ```
     /storage/emulated/0/test4.txt
     ```
   - Decrypt:
     ```
     /storage/emulated/0/test4.txt.enc
     ```

---

## 🔐 Features
- Generates a secure key (`key.key`)
- Encrypts any file using AES-level encryption
- Decrypts the file back to original
