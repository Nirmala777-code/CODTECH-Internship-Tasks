# ✅ Task 1: File Integrity Checker

## 📌 Objective
To monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing their SHA-256 hash values using Python.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3 (Pydroid 3 on Android)
- `hashlib` library
- Mobile file system (`/storage/emulated/0/...`)

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `task1_file_integrity_checker.py` – Python script to calculate SHA-256 hash
- `test.txt` – Sample test file used for checking integrity
- `task1_output.jpg/png` – Screenshot showing script output (hash value)

---

## 🧪 How It Works
1. The script asks for the **full path of a file**.
2. It reads the file in binary mode.
3. It calculates the **SHA-256 hash** using `hashlib`.
4. You can compare the hash value before and after any modification to detect changes.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Script (Mobile Friendly)
1. Open the script in **Pydroid 3**.
2. Run the script.
3. When asked, enter the full path to the test file:

/storage/emulated/0/CODTECH/Task1/test.txt

4. It will print the SHA-256 hash of the file.
5. Modify the file and re-run to check for changes.
