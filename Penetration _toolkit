# Task 3: Penetration Testing Toolkit

## 📌 Objective
Develop a Python-based toolkit with multiple penetration testing modules like:
- Port Scanner
- Brute-Forcer

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3 (Pydroid 3)
- `socket` for port scanning
- `requests` for brute-force simulation

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `task3_penetration_toolkit.py` – Main Python script
- `task3_output_ports.jpg` – Screenshot of port scan
- `task3_output_brute.jpg` – Screenshot of brute-force simulation

---

## ▶️ Modules Description

### 1. 🔍 Port Scanner
Scans ports 20–1024 of a target IP and shows open ports.

- Tested on: `scanme.nmap.org`

### 2. 🔐 Brute Forcer
Sends POST requests using a small wordlist to a dummy login endpoint.

- Tested on: `https://httpbin.org/post`

---

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open script in Pydroid 3
2. Choose option `1` or `2`
3. Input:
   - IP: `scanme.nmap.org`
   - URL: `https://httpbin.org/post`
