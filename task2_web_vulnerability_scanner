##Task 2: Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Objective
Detect common vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **XSS** in web applications.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3 (Pydroid 3)
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `task2_web_vulnerability_scanner.py`: Python script to test for XSS and SQLi
- `task2_output.jpg`: Screenshot showing detection result
- Sample test site: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?search=

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. The script takes a URL input.
2. Sends test payloads for:
   - XSS (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`)
   - SQLi (`' OR '1'='1`)
3. Analyzes the response to detect reflected payloads or error messages.

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the script in Pydroid 3.
2. Run the script.
3. When prompted, enter:


http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?search=
4. Script prints whether vulnerabilities exist.
5. Take a screenshot of the result.
